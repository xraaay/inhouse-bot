# Inhouse Bot
# Now uses slash commands! i.e. /inhouse 10
####  A Discord bot for organizing inhouse games in server.
---

 ## How it works
 ##### Upon receiving the inhouse command, the bot will send a message to collect players.  
 ##### React with a thumbs up to opt in to the inhouse.  
 ##### Once enough reactions are collected, the bot will send a message with the scrambled teams.  
 ##### The host can either accept (thumbs up) or reshuffle (thumbs down).  
 ##### If the teams are accepted, the bot will create two temporary voice channels and move each player to the correct channel.  
 ##### Once the voice channels are empty, the bot will remove the channels after a short delay.
